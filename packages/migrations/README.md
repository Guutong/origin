# Origin Migrations

This repository is used to deploy all the contracts for the Origin project of the Energy Web Foundation.

## How-to
- `npm install` - Install the dependencies

Method 1
- `npm run start-ganache` - Starts a local blockchain instance
- (new terminal window) `npm run origin-backend` - Starts a local backend instance
- (new terminal window) `npm start` - Deploys the contracts and the configuration in [config/demo-config.json](config/demo-config.json)

Method 2
- `npm run start-all`- Starts all script from Method 1 using concurrently

This will deploy all the contracts to a local Ganache instance and a local test backend.

## Interacting with the contracts
After they have been deployed, you can use the [EW Origin UI](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-origin-ui) to interact with the contracts through a user-friendly interface.

## Introduction

This repo is for demonstration purposes and to show how the certificate of origin can work. This repo will:
* deploy and setup all required smart contracts with the provided private key
* onboard users and devices
* set meterreading of devices
* trade certificates through transferring ownership and/or buying through ERC20 test tokens
* split certificates
* create demands, supplies and agreements

Currently the repo will <b>not</b> start the ui. You still have to do this by yourself.

After you clone this repo you have to run the command <code>npm install</code>. It will install all the required dependencies.

When the command is finished you have to start a blockchain:
* ganache / testrpc: to run this testchain simply run the command <code>npm run start-ganache</code>
* your own blockchain client connected to any ethereum-like chain (e.g. Tobalaba)

This demo is using raw-transactions, so you don't have to unlock your accounts in the blockchain-client. Because this demo was developed with Tobalaba in mind the current gasPrice is set to 0 thus enabling sending transaction from accounts without any balance.<br>
Currently the demo is configured to use the port <code>8545</code>. In case you're using your own client please make sure that the client is listening to that port. <br>

Apart from starting a blockchain you must also start a test backend server using the command <code>npm run origin-backend</code>. This is because, with release B some of the non-vital data is stored off chain on a server. Hence the deployment of test backend is necessary for demo purposes.<br>

We strongly recommend to change the keys included in this repo when running on a public chain (see configuration)

## Configuration

The configuration and flow of actions is done "by default" with the file [demo-config.json](config/demo-config.json) in the config-folder.

*NOTE: you could also pass a customized demo file into the <code>marketDemo()</code> function in the test script(<code>/src/test.ts</code>)*

The following keys are required:
* flow: an array with flow actions. They will get executed in the ordering within the config-file

### flow actions

Every flowaction has two entries:
* <code>type</code>: the action type
* <code>data</code>: the corresponding data for the action type

Currently the following action types are supported:
* APPROVE_CERTIFICATION_REQUEST
* CREATE_ACCOUNT
* CREATE_PRODUCING_DEVICE
* SAVE_SMARTMETER_READ_PRODUCING
* SEND_ERC20_TOKENS_TO
* TRANSFER_CERTIFICATE
* SPLIT_CERTIFICATE
* PUBLISH_CERTIFICATE_FOR_SALE
* PUBLISH_CERTIFICATE_FOR_SALE_OFFCHAIN
* REQUEST_CERTIFICATES
* UNPUBLISH_CERTIFICATE_FROM_SALE
* BUY_CERTIFICATE
* BUY_CERTIFICATE_BULK
* CREATE_DEMAND

## Docker

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run demo npm run start
```

If you would like to start a local Ganache server instance running on localhost:8545 please run this command:

```
docker-compose run -p 8545:8545 demo npm run start-ganache
```

And replace `localhost` in `connection-config.json`, `src/config.ts` to Docker host machine IP, for example: `172.17.0.1`.
